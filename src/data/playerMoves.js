// The moves a player can give their own founder.
//
// The Incubator lets an author type any frame data they like. A player gets a
// CURATED MENU instead — every entry here is a finished, sensible move with a
// clear identity, so nobody has to understand startup frames to build a fighter
// they enjoy.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ZERO-BUDGET RULE
//
// Human fighters all share one stat line. That rule was written in v1.7 after a
// wardrobe choice turned out to be worth a 33% damage swing on a ranked ladder,
// and it still holds: a player's STYLE is always `balanced`.
//
// So a player's build is not "pick the strongest thing" — it is "spend a budget
// of zero". Every priced knob and every move here costs or refunds, and the
// total has to come back to roughly nothing. Want a launcher? Be a bigger
// target, or accept slower frames. That is a real character-building decision
// AND it is fair by construction, which is a much better answer than banning
// variety outright.
//
// Shoulders, stride and head are unpriced by the budget, so silhouette is
// always free. A player can look like nobody else at zero cost.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
