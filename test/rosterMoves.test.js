// Every move of every fighter, fired in a live Game.
//
// The suite already checks that a character's numbers are well-formed
// (schema.test) and correctly priced (commandNormals.test). Neither notices a
// move that validates perfectly and then does nothing when you press the
// button — and that is the failure this project keeps hitting: command
// normals, the counter archetype, sim versioning and the Incubator each
// shipped valid and silently broken, found only by using them.
//
// So this drives the real pad path against a real Game. Two traps are baked in
// deliberately, because both cost real debugging time to find:
//
//   1. A round opens in `intro`. Inputs pressed then are discarded, so a
//      harness that presses on frame 0 reports the ENTIRE roster as dead.
//   2. Not every move sets `attack`. A dash changes state, a super sets a
//      buff timer, a steal moves meter. Watching `attack` alone reports those
//      as dead too.
//
// Assertions are "something happened", never exact damage — the numbers are
// balance and belong in config, not pinned here.
